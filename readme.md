# Tic Tac Toe Game with Theme switcher
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game (one of them being played by computer or human). In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares.

## Game rules:

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
